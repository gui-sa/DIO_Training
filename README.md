It's a place to save notes and challenges accomplished with DIO (Digital Innovation One) training.

 - [How to](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) write markdown (.md) files.

## Java/Kotlin Bootcamp:

The course started by:

 1. Jobs and Organizational Tasks
 2. Agile Development 
 3. Logic and Computational Thinking
    1. Requirements:
        - Functional: It is funtionalities 
        - Non-funtional : Funtionalities properties/How it works
    2. Which resources I do have (and is obtainable)
    3. What are the problems?
    4. Which requirements changing, or incertainty, might break your projects?
    5. Break your problem into a tree by reducing the problem in easier tasks
    6. For each task look for:
        - Patterns
        - Abstractions
        - Process
        - Math model
        - Data Struct
        - Big O techs
        - Design Patterns
        - Architecture Patterns 
        - Binary search
        - PA/PG
    7. Create an Diagram
    8. Implement!
 4. Git Github:
    - Git: local software
        - Distributed Logic
        - Works by using SHA1 for hash
        - Commits
        - Blobs
        - Trees
        - GitHub is a cloud based Git
        - git clone
        - git add (directory)
        - git commit -m (message)
        - git commit (will open text editor)
            - Use imperative verbs (subject): "Implements Functionality X"
            - Be more descriptive (Body)
            - Use reserved keywords (Futter) to redirect or versioning.
        - git push origin (branch)
        - git pull
        - git branch
        - git checkout -b (nova branch)
        - git log
        - git log --oneline
        - git checkout (branch or commit hash)
        - git config --global (properties or alias)
        - git stash
        - git merge
        - To pull request:
            1. Fork
            2. Clone
            3. Create new branch
            4. Push changings
            5. Pull requests that branch to Original one
        - Use SSH or Token to commit changings to cloud.
